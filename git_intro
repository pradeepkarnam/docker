**Git** and **GitHub** are powerful tools for version control and collaboration in software development, but they serve different purposes.

### **Git**
- **Git** is a **distributed version control system**. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
- Git tracks changes to your files (mainly source code), allowing you to **revert to earlier versions** of the files or compare changes.
- Git works locally on your system, allowing you to have a full history of changes without needing internet access.

#### Key Concepts in Git:
1. **Repository (Repo)**: A directory where Git tracks changes. It contains all your project files and Git history.
2. **Commit**: A snapshot of the changes in the project. It's like saving your work with a note describing what changes you made.
3. **Branch**: A separate line of development. Branches let you work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main code.
4. **Merge**: Combining branches together. Often used to integrate features or fixes from a separate branch into the main code.
5. **Clone**: Copying a Git repository from a remote location (like GitHub) to your local system.
6. **Push**: Sending changes from your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
7. **Pull**: Fetching and merging changes from a remote repository to your local one.

### **GitHub**
- **GitHub** is a web-based **platform** built on top of Git, designed for collaboration and sharing Git repositories.
- It hosts your Git repositories **online** so you can share them with others and collaborate on code in real-time.
- GitHub provides a user-friendly interface to manage repositories, review code changes, and handle collaborative development.

#### Key Features of GitHub:
1. **Repositories**: Just like with Git, you create repositories, but GitHub provides a space to store them online.
2. **Pull Requests**: A feature for code review and collaboration. It allows developers to suggest changes in a separate branch and request the repository owner to merge them.
3. **Issues**: A way to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to your project.
4. **Fork**: Copying someone else’s repository to your own GitHub account, allowing you to experiment or make changes without affecting the original repository.
5. **GitHub Actions**: Automate tasks such as testing, deployment, and more using continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
6. **Collaborators**: You can add other users to your GitHub repository, allowing them to contribute directly.

### Git + GitHub Workflow:
1. **Clone** a repository from GitHub to your local system.
2. Make changes and **commit** them locally using Git.
3. **Push** those changes back to GitHub to share with others.
4. Use **pull requests** to propose changes, review code, and merge contributions.

Git is for local version control, while GitHub provides an online platform to collaborate, manage, and share Git repositories.
